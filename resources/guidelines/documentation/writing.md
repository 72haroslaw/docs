# Writing

Once you are assigned to a certain topic or area, consider yourself the "knowledge lead" for this particular area of our documentation. Prepare a rough outline containing the following points and prompt other maintainers for feedback.

* Who is going to read this
* What are the prerequisites for readers?
* What are you going to write about ?
* Which questions are you going to answer?
* Which other topics might be relevant / interesting to read afterwards.

After you've discussed this abstract, start writing the first 30% of your article.

* Motivate sections of the documentation \(why do we do this or that?\)
* Try to use non Shopware-specific language when possible \(or explain them e.g. "DAL" / provide link to description\)
* Expect your readers to understand less than half of what you understand
* Have a common thread throughout your article
* Work with cross-references \(knowledge is a network, not a one-way-street\)

After writing the first 30%, consult a reviewer to give some initial feedback. Discuss the current progress, re-arrange some parts if needed and continue writing until you feel you're done.

Before finishing off the documentation, check back with your questions posed at the beginning, send it to another reviewer and finalise based on the feedback.
