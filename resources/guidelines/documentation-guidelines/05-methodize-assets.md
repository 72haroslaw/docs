# Methodize Assets

It is essential to organize and keep all the assets (images, files, videos, etc) used in our documentation. This section briefs you about how the assets are represented, managed and their naming conventions.

## Images

* Screenshots can be taken using GIMP, Snipping tools, or any tool that you have already worked on

* Use SVG instead of PNG images as SVGs stay sharp when you zoom in on the image

* Use the below-naming convention to save the image

    * <toc_topic_name>-<meaningful_image_name>.svg. For example, 
    ```
        storefront-pages.svg 
    ```
    * If sub-topic exists, <toc_topic_name>-<sub_topic_name>-<meaningful_image_name>.svg. For example, 
    ```    
        storefront-dataHandling-pages.svg 
    ```

    * The image names can be serialized if multiple images are under the same topic. For example,
    ```
        storefront-dataHandling-pages_01.svg 
    ```

* Use alt text and figure captions. This details what an image is trying to convey.

* An introductory sentence should precede most images. 

## File

Every file added to a folder can have a naming convention as:

<two_digit_number>-<meaningful_image_name>.md. For example,

        ```
        01-doc-process.md
        ```


## Video

* Provide captions and transcripts for video content

* A similar naming pattern as images can be also followed for video's
