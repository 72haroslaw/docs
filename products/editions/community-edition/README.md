# Community Edition

## Intro

The **Community Edition** is the open source, basic variant of Shopware which is free for everyone to use. All other
Shopware editions, such as [Professional](../professional-edition.md), [Enterprise](../enterprise-edition)
and [Cloud](../../cloud-1.md) are based upon the Community Edition and include plugins, which are only available in
these editions.

## Running Shopware

There are several opportunities running Shopware in general. This does not only match the Community Edition, but also
the Professional Edition and Enterprise Edition. When speaking of the Community Edition let's be more precise talking
about the Shopware Platform, which can be included inside
several [setup templates](../../../guides/installation/overview.md#setup-templates) or can be shipped as a
One-Click-Installer. Of course, there are other operation forms like Docker, Vagrant, Valet+, which are explained in
the [installation guide](../../../guides/installation) section. Inside that section you will also find
the [system requirements](../../../guides/installation/overview.md#prerequisites) needed for running Shopware as a PHP
application built upon Symfony.
