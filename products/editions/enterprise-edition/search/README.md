# Search

Shopware Enterprise Search is an advanced search module using [Elasticsearch](../../../../concepts/framework/architecture/elasticsearch.md).
In addition to a high performance product search, it also offers you the possibilities to customize the search experience depending on your needs. So you could also search for manufacturers and categories.
The simple administration module allows quick and easy configuration of the search.

Before continuing, you should make sure you have a basic knowledge of Elasticsearch and the Shopware implementation.
