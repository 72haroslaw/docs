Shopware Enterprise cloud is available at request for Shopware Enterprise merchants. Please approach the Shopware Sales to get more information on Shopware Enterprise cloud
{% endhint %}

Shopware Enterprise cloud is a platform-as-a-service to host, deploy and scale for your individual Shopware project.
It comes with the full flexibility and code ownership of a self-managed Shopware project, but takes away the complexity of building custom infrastructure, build & testing pipelines or deployment automation.

Get started by installing the Enteprise cloud CLI on your local development machine.
