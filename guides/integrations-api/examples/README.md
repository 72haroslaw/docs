# Examples

In almost every eCommerce project, at some point you will have to integrate different systems and processes with your store in order to minimise repetitive and tedious manual work. Sometimes the scale of your product catalog, orders, customers doesn't even allow for manual management.

These processes include tasks like

* Product imports
* Stock updates
* Order exports
* Customer synchronisations

As these integrations are usually very specific to your individual project, we have collected some guidelines and best practices that can serve as a framework for you to determine the correct setup of your data environment.

For example, take a look at our recommendations for product and category imports.
