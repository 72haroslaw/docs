# Extensions

As a Shopware developer, your main work will be to develop extensions that enhance or modify the functionality of Shopware in a specific way. Shopware offers different types of extensions, each with its own benefits and implications. To make sure you don't get lost in all the options, take a look at the extension [overview](overview.md) article which compares the approaches.

Alternatively, if you want to dive straight in, take a look at our introduction guides:

{% page-ref page="plugins/plugin-base-guide.md" %}

{% page-ref page="apps/app-base-guide.md" %}

{% page-ref page="themes/theme-base-guide.md" %}

These guides are essential information on how to create, configure, and extend you store with Shopware extensions.
