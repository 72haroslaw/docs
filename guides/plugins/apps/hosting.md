## Does your app need hosting

Not all apps need hosting. If your app needs a server depends on the kinds of
functionalities that it uses.

- **Features that require a server**
  - Custom Modules
  - Action Buttons
  - Webhooks
  - Payment Processing
- **Features that work without a server**
  - Themes
  - Template changes
  - CMS Blocks
  - App configuration
  
## Hosting Options

Modern server providers offer serveral more or less labour intensive ways to
host web based applications. Here are the most common ones starting with the
most labour intensive.

### Dedicated server

A dedicated server is the classic way to host performance critical
applications. With this model you rent one or serveral pieces of hardware from
your provider. This is cheaper in if your order compute and memory resources in
bulk. But this model also has the drawback of high management overhead. With a
dedicated server you are responsible for os and software upgrades, as well as
backups.

### Infrastructure as a Service

So called IaaS providers already provide a solid layer of abstraction over
dedicated hosting solutions. With an IaaS model you are no longer forced to rent
physical pieces of hardware, but rather virtual machines with configurable
amounts of compute power and memory. Another improvement is the availability of
of so called managet services.
