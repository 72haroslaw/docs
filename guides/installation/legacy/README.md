# Legacy Setup

The Legacy Setup is an older installation procedure that was used in previous versions of Shopware. It involves a more traditional installation process where users manually configure the database and upload the Shopware files to their server. The Legacy Setup requires a bit more technical knowledge and manual configuration steps compared to the Community Setup.
