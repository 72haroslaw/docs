# Extensions

In order to provide users \(i.e. developers\) with a clear abstraction, Shopware consists of a core which designed in a way that allows for a lot of **extensibility** without sacrificing maintainability or structural integrity. Some of those concepts were already introduced in the [Frameworks](../framework/) section. However, the main domain for extensions \(that leverage those very concepts\) are [**Apps**](apps-concept.md) and [**Plugins**](../../products/plugins/). The following section will discuss what they can be used for.

Refer to our Guides section to learn how to use both extension systems, and also how they differ:
