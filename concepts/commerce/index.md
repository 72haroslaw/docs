# Commerce

At core, Shopware is a **commerce platform**. If you want to understand the commerce-related concepts of our software, make sure to go here.

::: info
The **Concepts** section does not contain code examples, instead it we focus on conveying the concepts and ideas behind the software. If you want more guided, step-by-step tutorials, please head to the [**Guides**](../../guides/installation/) section.
